**Holoviews and Bokeh for Viewing a Kriged Grid (KT3D GSLIB)**

Short little demo for reshaping KT3D output and viewing with holoviews.

Turns out holoviews is pretty slick!

The output doesn't render on github directly, but it works when wrapped with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ericbdaniels/holoviews_kt3d/blob/master/kriging_holoviews.ipynb).

Plenty more that can be done with this.
